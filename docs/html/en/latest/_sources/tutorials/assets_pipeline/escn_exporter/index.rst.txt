Blender ESCN exporter
=====================

To export from Blender to Redot 4.x, use one of the 
:ref:`available 3D formats <doc_importing_3d_scenes_available_formats>`.

The plugin `Redot Blender Exporter <https://github.com/redot-engine/redot-engine-blender-exporter>`__ 
is not maintained or supported in Redot 4.x. While not officially supported, the plugin may 
partially work for some Redot and Blender versions, particularly before Blender version 4.0.
For complete docs on the Blender exporter, see the 
`previous version of this page </en/4.0/tutorials/assets_pipeline/escn_exporter/index.html>`__.
