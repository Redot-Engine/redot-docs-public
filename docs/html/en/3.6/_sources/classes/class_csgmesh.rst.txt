A CSG Mesh shape that uses a mesh resource.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

This CSG node allows you to use any mesh resource as a CSG shape, provided it is closed, does not self-intersect, does not contain internal faces and has no edges that connect to more than two faces. See also :ref:`CSGPolygon<class_CSGPolygon>` for drawing 2D extruded polygons to be used as CSG nodes.

\ **Note:** CSG nodes are intended to be used for level prototyping. Creating CSG nodes has a significant CPU cost compared to creating a :ref:`MeshInstance<class_MeshInstance>` with a :ref:`PrimitiveMesh<class_PrimitiveMesh>`. Moving a CSG node within another CSG node also has a significant CPU cost, so it should be avoided during gameplay.

The :ref:`Material<class_Material>` used in drawing the CSG shape.

.. rst-class:: classref-property

:ref:`Mesh<class_Mesh>` **mesh**

.. rst-class:: classref-property-setget

- void **set_mesh** **(** :ref:`Mesh<class_Mesh>` value **)**
- :ref:`Mesh<class_Mesh>` **get_mesh** **(** **)**

The :ref:`Mesh<class_Mesh>` resource to use as a CSG shape.

\ **Note:** When using an :ref:`ArrayMesh<class_ArrayMesh>`, avoid meshes with vertex normals unless a flat shader is required. By default, CSGMesh will ignore the mesh's vertex normals and use a smooth shader calculated using the faces' normals. If a flat shader is required, ensure that all faces' vertex normals are parallel.
