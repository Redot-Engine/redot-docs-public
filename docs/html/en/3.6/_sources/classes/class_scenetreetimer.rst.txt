SceneTreeTimer
==============

**Inherits:** :ref:`Reference<class_Reference>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

One-shot timer.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

A one-shot timer managed by the scene tree, which emits :ref:`timeout<class_SceneTreeTimer_signal_timeout>` on completion. See also :ref:`SceneTree.create_timer<class_SceneTree_method_create_timer>`.

As opposed to :ref:`Timer<class_Timer>`, it does not require the instantiation of a node. Commonly used to create a one-shot delay timer as in the following example:

::

    func some_function():
        print("Timer started.")
        yield(get_tree().create_timer(1.0), "timeout")
        print("Timer ended.")

The timer will be dereferenced after its time elapses. To preserve the timer, you can keep a reference to it. See :ref:`Reference<class_Reference>`.
